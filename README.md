# Paper Repository

This repository contains the code to implement all examples in our paper: Conditional calibration for false discovery rate control under dependence. A new version will be released in a few days with all dBH/dSU functions implemented in the dBH package. 

## Introduction
All R scripts are included in the folder `R/`. The bash files to submit jobs to the cluster are included in the folder `jobs/` (note that this depends on your cluster and the bash file might need to be changed accordingly). The outputs and the plots are included in the folder `data/` and the folder `figs/`, respectively. 

## R scripts
The folder `R/` contains all R scripts:

- `dBH_mvgauss_`
## Submitting jobs, Postprocessing results, and generating plots
